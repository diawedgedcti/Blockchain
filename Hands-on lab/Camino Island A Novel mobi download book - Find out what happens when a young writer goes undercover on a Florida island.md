The novel begins with a daring heist from a secure vault deep below Princeton Universityâs Firestone Library. A gang of thieves manages to escape with five handwritten manuscripts of F. Scott Fitzgeraldâs most famous novels, including The Great Gatsby. Princeton has insured the manuscripts for twenty-five million dollars, but the FBI has no leads on the culprits or the whereabouts of the priceless documents.
 
Meanwhile, Mercer Mann, a young novelist with a severe case of writerâs block, is approached by a mysterious woman who works for a company that specializes in recovering stolen art and rare books. She offers Mercer a generous sum of money to go undercover on Camino Island, where Bruce Cable, a charismatic and wealthy bookstore owner, is suspected of having connections to the black market for rare books. Mercer agrees to the assignment, hoping to find inspiration for her next novel and to pay off her student loans.
 
On Camino Island, Mercer befriends Bruce and his eclectic group of friends, who are all avid readers and writers. She soon finds herself drawn to Bruceâs charm and his passion for books, but she also senses that he is hiding something. As she gets closer to the truth, she realizes that she is in over her head and that her life may be in danger. She must decide whether to risk everything for a chance to save the priceless manuscripts or to walk away from the biggest story of her life.

Camino Island: A Novel has received mixed reviews from critics and readers alike. Some praised Grisham's departure from his usual legal thrillers and his exploration of the book world, while others criticized his lack of suspense, depth, and originality. The novel has been described as "a delightfully lighthearted caper" [^1^], "a tepid parody of Fitzgerald and Hemingway's Left Bank" [^2^], and "a multilayered game of cat and mouse" [^3^]. The novel has also spawned a sequel, Camino Winds, which was published in 2020 and follows the aftermath of a hurricane on the island.

Camino Island: A Novel is a book for book lovers who enjoy a fast-paced and entertaining read with a touch of romance and intrigue. It is not a book for those who expect a gripping and complex crime thriller with realistic characters and scenarios. It is a book that showcases Grisham's versatility and passion for writing, as well as his love for books and the people who create them.

Camino Island: A Novel has not been adapted into a movie yet, despite Grisham's popularity and success in Hollywood. Grisham has said that it has been 15 years since his last legal thriller was made into a film, and that he has several projects under contract that have been stalled for years.  He has also lamented the lack of interest in adult dramas and the dominance of superhero franchises in the movie industry.
 
However, Grisham has not given up on his cinematic dreams. He has said that he would love to see Camino Island on the big screen, and that he has a vision of who should play the main characters. He has suggested Matthew McConaughey as Bruce Cable, Reese Witherspoon as Mercer Mann, and Morgan Freeman as Noelle Bonnet, the head of the underground agency.  He has also expressed his enthusiasm for his sequel, Camino Winds, which takes place during a hurricane on the island and involves a murder mystery.
 
Camino Island: A Novel is a book that could make a great movie, if only Hollywood would take notice. It has all the elements of a thrilling and entertaining story: a daring heist, a charming bookstore owner, a young writer in disguise, a priceless treasure, and a tropical setting. It is a book that invites readers to imagine themselves as part of the adventure, and to hope that one day they will see it on the big screen.
