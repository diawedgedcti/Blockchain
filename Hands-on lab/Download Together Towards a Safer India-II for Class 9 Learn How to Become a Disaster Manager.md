Disaster management is the process of planning, organizing, coordinating, and implementing actions to prevent, reduce, and cope with the impact of disasters on people, property, and environment. Disasters are sudden and unpredictable events that cause widespread damage, disruption, or loss of life. They can be natural, such as earthquakes, floods, cyclones, landslides, etc., or man-made, such as fires, accidents, terrorist attacks, wars, etc.
 
Disaster management involves four phases: prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery. Prevention refers to the measures taken to avoid or minimize the occurrence or severity of disasters. Preparedness refers to the measures taken to enhance the capacity and readiness of individuals and communities to face and deal with disasters. Response refers to the measures taken to provide immediate relief and assistance to the affected people and areas during and after a disaster. Recovery refers to the measures taken to restore and rehabilitate the normal functioning and living conditions of the affected people and areas after a disaster.
 
Disaster management is a collective and collaborative effort that requires the participation and contribution of various stakeholders, such as government agencies, non-governmental organizations, civil society groups, media, private sector, academic institutions, scientific and technical experts, and most importantly, the disaster-affected people themselves. Disaster management also requires a holistic and integrated approach that considers the social, economic, environmental, cultural, and political aspects of disasters and their impacts. Disaster management also requires a proactive and preventive approach that focuses on reducing the risk and vulnerability of people and assets to disasters rather than just reacting to them.
