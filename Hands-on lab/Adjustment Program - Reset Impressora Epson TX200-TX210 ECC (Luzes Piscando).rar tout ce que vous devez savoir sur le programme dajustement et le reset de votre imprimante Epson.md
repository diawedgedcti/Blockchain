## Step 5: Choose Your Adjustment Mode
 
After selecting your printer model, you will see another window with two options: "Particular Adjustment Mode" and "Maintenance". Click on the button that says "Particular Adjustment Mode". This will open another window where you can choose the type of adjustment you want to perform on your printer.
 
## Step 6: Reset Your Printer
 
In the window that opens, you will see a list of adjustment functions. The most common one is "Waste Ink Pad Counter", which resets the counter that measures how much ink has been used by your printer. If your printer is displaying an error message that says "A printer's ink pad is at the end of its service life" or "Parts inside your printer are near the end of their service life", you need to reset this counter. To do so, click on "Waste Ink Pad Counter" and then click on "OK". This will open another window where you can check and reset the counter.
 
In this window, click on "Check" to see the current value of the counter. It will show a percentage that indicates how much ink has been used by your printer. If it is close to or above 100%, you need to reset it. To do so, click on "Initialization" and then click on "OK". This will reset the counter to zero and clear the error message. You may see a message that says "Please turn off printer". If so, turn off your printer and then turn it back on
